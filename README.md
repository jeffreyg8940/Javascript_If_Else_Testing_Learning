# Javascript_If_Else_Testing_Learning
This is me learning javascript if/else statements and different operators such as &amp;&amp; and || as well as different data types.

this is written in just a normal Javascript file and using a script tag in html, im sure these are super simple and might not be as omptimised as they could be, if you see this repository and have some improvements please feel free to DM me!
